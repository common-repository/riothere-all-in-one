This is the Backend of our Reactjs/Nextjs Frontend eCommerce template. You can find the template and experiment with it on [Riothere](https://riothere.com/ "Customizable eCommerce Template")

== Description ==

If you're looking for a customizable eCommerce template with a WooCommerce backend and a React Frontend (on the Nextjs framework),
then you're in the right place.
Easily configure the branding of the Frontend to your liking (see the "Branding" screenshot below).
When you purchase this plugin, our technical team will get in touch with you to setup both the Frontend and the Backend for you on a server of your choosing.
If you wish, we can also create an EC2 machine fully setup with both the Backend and the Frontend then transfer ownership to you
to be directly used on production.
Note that you will NOT receive the Frontend code but we are ready to discuss any customizations you may require.
